# Introduction

This is the page of the undergraduate thesis of **Antonio Fernando Silva e Cruz Filho** e **Jo√£o Gabriel Andrade de Araujo Josephik**, advised by Professor **Nina Hirata**.

The goal of the project is to study, explore and compare different explainability methods for Convolutional Neural Networks.

# Proposal

Modern neural networks are very complex, formed by billions of parameters spread on multiple layers. Therefore, those system are often seen as "black box" systems: it's possible to visualize the input and output, but not the internal mechanisms of the network.

In this context, multiple methods were developed over the years to shed a light in the "reasoning" behind the system decisions. We aim to study methods developed specifically for Convolutional Networks.
